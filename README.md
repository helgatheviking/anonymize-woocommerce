# Anonymize Woocommerce
Adds WooCommerce tool to anonymize user and order data. This will:

1. Run all the WooCommerce registered privacy erasers for every user.
2. Run the WooCommerce privacy eraser for every order.
3. Anonymize all your user emails, logins, names, etc.

This will _not_ anonymize other plugins' data.
